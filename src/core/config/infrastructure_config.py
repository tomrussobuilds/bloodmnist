"""
Infrastructure & Resource Lifecycle Management.

This module provides the operational bridge between the declarative configuration 
and the physical execution environment. It manages the 'clean-start' and 
'graceful-stop' sequences, ensuring that hardware resources are optimized 
and that concurrent experimental runs do not collide via filesystem-level locks.

Key Operational Tasks:
    * Process Sanitization: Guards against ghost processes and accidental 
      multi-process collisions in local environments.
    * Environment Locking: Implements a mutual exclusion (Mutex) strategy 
      to synchronize access to experimental outputs.
    * Resource De-allocation: Ensures GPU/MPS caches are flushed and temporary 
      system artifacts are purged upon exit.
